today deanna was at home which was nice.  We had a birthday party for Albertina, her birthday was
a few days ago but she didn't seem to mine.  I would like to get out with the telescope one
evening and look at Venus before it sets.  It should be very close to optimal viewing now.

I am struggling a bit to get new contracts for work.  Sound United projects are still coming
along but i would like to get some experience away from them to start my own thing.  I
interviewed with 3nod in China and thought that would work out but after about a month they let
me know that it wasn't going to happen, that was disappointing.

I am going to help out with the AV setup at church tomorrow morning.  I'm not sure what they will
need me to do but it's a good way to get involved and use my skill set to plug into the church
community.  Going forward I will be envolved with both the band and the sound teams.  I hope that
doesn't burn me out.
