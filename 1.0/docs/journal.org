** To work on
*** buffer state  is handled differently in main loop, consider pulling it into journal_io.c
*** For searches entire .journal_log is read into a character array causing size limitations
**** Consider a different implementation reading one token at a time instead
*** Buffer implementation may need to be adjusted
**** Cannot use arrow keys in buffer - should be slienced and disabled if not used
***** would have to re-write screen including line wrapping
*** Would like to search within search results any number of times
*** Would like no restriction on buffer size for journal entries
*** Would like search term to be highlighted in search results
*** Need to comment code
*** Need to document program
*** Need to document functions
*** Need to refactor code
